## Meeting Summary: Component Utility Topology

During our recent session, we explored the following key points:

- **Component Utility Topology:**  
  - **What:** A design approach focusing on creating small, reusable utility components.
  - **Why:** To promote modularity, ease of maintenance, and scalability in our frontend code.
  - **Benefits:** Reduces complexity by isolating UI elements, improves reusability, and enhances overall performance.

- **Using Quasar:**  
  - We discussed how Quasar’s extensive library of pre-built components accelerates our development process.
  - Emphasis was placed on structuring components (e.g., headers, footers, cards, buttons) and maintaining consistency across the project.
  - Action items included reviewing the current codebase to refactor and isolate utility components for future reuse.
